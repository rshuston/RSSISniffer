# RSSI Sniffer

An RSSI sniffer application to support the investigation and development of RSSI tracking
algorithms.

The application tracks detected Bluetooth devices and applies a Kalman filter to smooth the RSSI measurements.

For information on the Kalman filter models, you can view my [RSSI filter](https://github.com/rshuston/RSSISniffer/blob/master/Articles/rssi-filter.pdf) notes.
